%% This is the Homework LaTeX template.  Use this file to fill in your solutions.

%% Notes: 
%%    1. If possibly, try to write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution}
%%    environment.
%%
%%    2. If you enter your answers into this Homework*.tex source file, you
%%    will have to compile it into a pdf document.  There are a number of ways to
%%    do that. Probably the easiest is to use the website called ShareLaTeX.com.
%%    Alternatively,
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%       Windows users: ...proTeXt maybe? (or switch to a better operating system) 
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so (on Linux) you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once (assuming
%%       you have everything set up properly).
%%
%%    3. Please don't hesitate to inform the professor if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' on GitHub or post to Piazza or ask in lecture.
%%
%%    4. Update the title and date if necessary.

\noindent {\bf Instructions.}
\begin{itemize}
\item This assignment must be completed in the Carver 449 computer lab by 2pm on
  \begin{quote}
    {\bf Friday February 12.}  
  \end{quote}
  Late submissions will not be accepted.
Here is a summary of what it takes to complete each part of the lab.
More detailed instructions appear on the following pages.
\item {\bf Part 1.} To complete this part, you must login to your account on the 
  Math Department Sage server and demonstrate that you know how to input a matrix, augment a matrix with a vector,
  and compute the echelon form of an (augmented) matrix.  

  Completing Part 1 is worth 1 point. If you are not interested in completing Part 2 of the
  assignment, you may turn in your paper and leave the lab after completing Part 1. \\
  {\bf Make sure your name is on your paper and it was signed by the instructor.}
\item {\bf Part 2.} To complete Part 2, you must first download the Sage worksheet file 
  Math317-Lab2.sws from either Blackboard or GitHub, load this worksheet into your Sage session
  and follow the instructions provided.  You must then save your completed Sage worksheet 
  to a file and upload the resulting sws file to Blackboard.

\item When you have finished working or it is 2pm (whichever comes first): 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf stop your Sage worksheet} (Action $\rightarrow$ Save and quit worksheet; or use Stop button),
  \item {\bf sign out of Sage}, 
  \item {\bf logout of your computer}, 
  \item {\bf write your name on your paper},
  \item {\bf hand it in to the instructor}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


%--  Part 1  ---------------------------------------------------
\section*{Part 1}
In Homework 3, we proved that the vector 
    $\vb = (1, -1, 1, -1)$ is as a linear combination 
    of the vectors 
    $\vv_1 = (1 , 0 , 1 , -2)$, 
    $\vv_2 = (0 , -1 , 0 , 1)$, and 
    $\vv_3 = (1, -2 , 1 , 0)$.  Do you remember how we did this?
    That's right! We recognized that if
    the matrix $A$ has first column $\vv_1$, second column $\vv_2$, and third
    column $\vv_3$, then writing $\vb$ as a linear combination of 
    the given vectors is the same as solving the system $A\vx = \vb$.
    That is, if we find $\vx = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ that solves 
    this system, then $\vb = x_1\vv_1+x_2\vv_2+x_3\vv_3$ is the
    desired linear combination. 

    In this first part of this lab assignment, we will simply re-solve the above problem, but 
    this time we will make Sage do the tedious work.  Carry out the following steps:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Login to any machine in Carver 449, open up a browser (preferably Chrome) and navigate to

    \begin{quote}
      \url{https://sage.math.iastate.edu/}
    \end{quote}

    Login to your account on the Math Department Sage server using the login information you
    were given for Lab 1. Once you are logged in, create a new worksheet and name it Lab2.  

    \item In the Lab2 worksheet, click the first cell and type the following:
    \begin{sageblock}
      b = vector([1, -1, 1, -1]); print b
    \end{sageblock}
    Then type Shift+Enter or click `evaluate`.
    Did Sage print what you expect? If so, move on.  If not, try again and/or ask the instructor for help.
  
  \item Click somewhere inside the next cell and enter the following  expression:
    \begin{sageblock}
      A = matrix(4, 3, [1, 0, 1, 0, -1, -2, 1, 0, 1, -2, 1, 0]) 
      print A
    \end{sageblock}
    What did Sage print?  Is it a matrix with three columns, 
    $\vv_1$, $\vv_2$, $\vv_3$? If not, try again and/or your neighbor for help.
    Can you decypher the syntax we used to input this matrix $A \in \R^{4\times 3}$?
    If so, move on.  If not, think a litter harder and/or discuss it with your neighbor.
\item Next, have Sage augment the matrix $A$ with the vector $b$ by entering the following into the
  next worksheet cell:
    \begin{sageblock}
      Ab = A.augment(b, subdivide=True)
      print Ab
    \end{sageblock}
\item Ask Sage to put your augmented matrix in reduced-row echelon form:
    \begin{sageblock}
      Ab.rref()
    \end{sageblock}
    You should now see two pivots (both equal to 1).  Let the free variable $x_3 = s$ and write 
    the vector $\vb$ as a linear combination of the vectors $\vv_1$, $\vv_2$, $\vv_3$
    involving $s$.
  \end{enumerate}
\vskip5mm
\[
  \vb = \begin{bmatrix*}[r] 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ -1\end{bmatrix*}= \text{\underline{\phantom{XXX}}}\vv_1 + \text{\underline{\phantom{XXX}}} \vv_2+
\text{\underline{\phantom{XXX}}} \vv_3.
\]
\vskip5mm
\noindent  If you want to stop here, ask the instructor to check your work and sign below
then save and quit. Otherwise, move on to Part 2 by loading the \href{https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math317-Spring2016/raw/master/computerlab/Math317-Lab2.sws}{Math317-Lab2.sws} file into your 
Sage session.

%--  Part 2  ---------------------------------------------------
\section*{Part 2}
In this part we will use Sage to solve the last exercise of Homework 4.
Recall, in that problem, we had
  $A = \begin{bmatrix*}[r] 1&1&1\\0&1&1\\1&2&1\end{bmatrix*}$ 
    and 
    $\vb = \begin{bmatrix*}[r] 3\\0\\1\end{bmatrix*}$.
      \begin{sageblock}
        A = matrix([[1,0,1],[1,1,2],[1,1,1]]) 
      \end{sageblock}
      Use Sage to compute $A^{-1}$.
      Try changing the 2 in the matrix $A$ to 1 and then take the inverse.  What happens?
      Using your answer to (i) to solve $A\vx = \vb$.
      \item Use your answer to (ii) to express $\vb$ as a linear combination of the columns of $A$.
      \end{enumerate}

\end{document}
      
    \end{sageblock}

    If a 4 appears in the worksheet, congratulations on completing Part 1. Ask the
    instructor to check your work and sign below, then do Part 2 (or Save \& quit if you want to stop here):\\
