The subdirectories here are

+ [pdf][]: pdf files containing problems assigned for each homework;  
+ [tex][]: the source files from which the pdf files are compiled.  

(For solutions to homework problems, please visit the resources tab of our Piazza page.)

### Typing your homework solutions

*Students are strongly encouraged (but not required) to type homework solutions.*

However, if you decide you don't want to type your solutions, then you must
print out the pdf file (use the "extra-space" version, when available) and write your final
answers in the space provided. 
(This makes it much easier for the grader to find your solutions and
this will make her much happier while grading your work!)

If you decide to type your solutions, please use the
[LaTeX document preparation system](http://www.latex-project.org/).
For those who don't already know how to use LaTeX,
there is plenty of online documentation to help you get started, but
please *feel free to ask the professor for help!*  

At the bottom of this page are some [links to LaTeX resources](#latex-resources). 

Type your solutions directly into the .tex file---for example, 
Homework01.tex---found in the [tex][] subdirectory, then compile this file
to produce a pdf file. This requires a program like pdflatex. 
Alternatively, you can upload the Homework01.tex file to 
the website [ShareLaTeX.com](http://www.sharelatex.com) 
and edit and compile right in your web browser.

When you are finished, print off a hardcopy of your pdf file and submit in at the beginning of the lecture on the due date.
