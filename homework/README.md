### General remarks

*Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests, and ultimately to do well in the course!*

Homework will be assigned roughly once per week and will typically
be due on Friday at the beginning of class.
The last homework assignment will be due during the last week
of the semester, also known as "dead week."  

Solutions to most homework exercises will be made available
soon after the due date. Check the "Resources" section of our Piazza page 

### Submission instructions

You must submit a *hard copy* of your homework at the **beginning of
class** on the due date. Homework submitted at the end of class on the
due date will incur a **10% penalty**.  Homework submitted after then end of
class on the due date will not be accepted or graded.  

You must turn in a hard copy of your work.
Except under extenuating circumstances,

**electronic homework submissions are not acceptable**

so please do not submit homework via email.

### Grading

Homework accounts for **25% of the course grade**.  

**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  

At least one (possibly more) of the lowest or missed homework scores
will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.
*The 10 best homework scores will count toward the final grade.*  

### Typing your solutions

*Students are strongly encouraged to type homework solutions.*

However, if you decide you don't want to type your solutions, then you must
print out the pdf file (use the "extra-space" version, when available) and write your
solutions in the space provided. 
(This makes it much easier for the grader to find your solutions and
this will make her much happier while grading your work!)


If you decide to type your solutions, please use the
[LaTeX document preparation system](http://www.latex-project.org/).
For those who don't already know how to use LaTeX,
there is plenty of online documentation to help you get started, but
please *feel free to ask the professor for help!*  

At the bottom of this page are some [links to LaTeX resources](#latex-resources). 

Type your solutions directly into the .tex file---for example, 
Homework01.tex---found in the [tex][] subdirectory, then compile this file
to produce a pdf file. This requires a program like pdflatex. 
Alternatively, you can upload the Homework01.tex file to 
the website [ShareLaTeX.com](http://www.sharelatex.com) 
and edit and compile right in your web browser.

When you are finished, print off a hardcopy of your pdf file and submit in at the beginning of the lecture on the due date.
